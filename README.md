•	Generated feature vectors for processing 50,000 IMDB reviews and 900,000 tweets while achieving an accuracy of 
~85% and ~64% respectively
•	The first one was Doc2Vec technique where document vectors are learned via artificial neural networks which captures 
the context of the words while reducing the size of the data.
•	The second technique used was traditional NLP technique where the features were words selected that occurred in at 
least 1% of either of positive or negative texts and occurred twice as many times in positive/negative reviews as compared 
negative/positive reviews.  and the feature vectors are simple binary vectors
